I have been climbing since high school and Planet Rock has been my home gym for over 7 years. I've also been in a few local competitions and I'm super psyched to travel and compete with the team! When I'm not climbing, I also enjoy skiing, longboarding, and backpacking. "

      content : "I’m a junior studying Neuroscience. I’m planning to go into sleep or addiction research, and I love talking about BrAiN tHinGs. I was raised by a trad-dad, but I really started getting into climbing my junior year of high school. The pandemic put a big hole in my climbing plans, and like many climbers, when I stopped being able to climb in the gym or at state/national parks, I resorted to climbing more unusual rock-formations, including the stone wall behind my hometown library dumpster (ew). In addition to climbing, I’m also big into surfing, open-water swimming, playing video games, and watching anime. "

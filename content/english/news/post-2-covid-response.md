## Athlete Safety is Our Priority

### Our plan to return to safe play

We are following all State of Michigan, University of Michigan, University of Michigan Recreational Sports, and USA Climbing regulations and guidelines when planning our return to training and competing.

We're looking to restart virtual practices while we wait to safely restart in-person exercise. Sign up on <a href=https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:Michigan%20Climbing%20Team>MCommunity</a> to start receiving team emails with more updates.

### Not on campus this semester?

We've got workout plans that will be accessible to everyone, regardless of your location posted on this website. Please contact us if you're concerned about getting involved when off campus.

## Athlete Safety is Our Priority

### Our plan to return to safe play

We are following all State of Michigan, University of Michigan, University of Michigan Recreational Sports, and USA Climbing regulations and guidelines when planning our return to training and competing.

We have lots of ideas and details will be published soon.

### Not on campus this semester?

We're working on workout plans that will be accessible to everyone, regardless of your location. Please contact us if you're concerned about getting involved when off campus.
